### Hi, I'm Robbie!

I am a final year Computer Science BSc Undergraduate at The University of Glasgow. I love learning about new technologies and have a particular interest in HCI. I am currently working on my final year project which concerns the Social Acceptability of Novel Interaction Techniques. To explore this area, I am developing an Android App that will take make use of Device Motion Gestures. I also have experience using Java, Python, and other programming languages.
